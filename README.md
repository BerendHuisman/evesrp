[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paxswill/evesrp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paxswill/evesrp)

So, this is still in-progress, and I'm putting off writing a real readme until
it's closer to a real release. IN the mean time, here're some
[screenshots][screens]

## Developing

### Dependencies

In addition to the dependencies listed in setup.py/requirements.txt, EVE-SRP
depends on a Javascript packages. A couple of them are Node.js command line
utilities (UglifyJS2, LESS), but the majority are used as part of the user
interface. To install all development dependencies at once you can use the
`build-deps` make target:

    make build-deps

This will install all of the Python and Javascript dependencies needed for
developing EVE-SRP.
After you've installed the dependencies, you'll need to generate the CSS and
Javascript sources.

    make all

If the Javascript minimization is causing a problem, you can disable it by
defining the `DEBUG` variable for make.

    DEBUG="true" make all

To run the development server, you can use the included `evesrp` command line
utility. I recommend installing the project in editable mode to get access to
it.

    ./setup.py develop
    evesrp -c config.py runserver

## Deploying

If all you want to do is run EVE-SRP, you can skip the steps above and install
it from PyPI (in a virtualenv!) like this:

    pip install EVE-SRP

You will also need the appropriate adapter for your database of choice. For
example, I use PostgreSQL, and use the psycopg2 adapter:

    pip install psycopg2

From there, you just need to create an instance of the app and run it. The
simple example below uses Flask's built-in webserver.

    from evesrp import create_app
    
    app = create_app()
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'engine://connect/args'
    app.config['USER_AGENT_EMAIL'] = 'email@example.com'
    # Need to add generic AuthMethod, probably OpenID based
    app.config['AUTH_METHODS'] = [TestAuth(), ]
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'random string'
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.extensions['sqlalchemy'].db.create_all(app=app)
        app.run()

### Dependencies

EVE-SRP requires Python 2.7 or >=3.3 and a database (with connector) that is
supported by [SQLAlchemy][sqla-db-support]. EVE-SRP is typically developed
against PostgreSQL with the [psycopg2][psycopg2] adapter. It is also tested
regularly with the following database adapters:

* [pg8000](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pg8000/)
* [CyMySQL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cymysql)
* [PyMySQL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMySQL)
* [MySQL-Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python) (Python 2.7 only)
