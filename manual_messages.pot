#. Text shown for individual user results when granting permissions. The HTML
#. tags (<small class="text-muted"> etc) should
#. be moved to go around the authentication source. An example of the output
#. for this will be something like "Paxswill from Test OAuth" with the text
#. "from Test OAuth" being smaller and less visible as it's not as important
#. as the user's name.

#. Text shown for group results when granting permissions. As with the user
#. results, the HTML tags should be moved to accomodate the localized text. An
#. additional bit of information should be displayed, the number of users in a
#. group. The English version has the form
#. "Test Alliance(2134) from Test OAuth" with the group name being
#. "Test Alliance" and that group having 2134 member users.
